# OSI Model

## Overview
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework with 7 layers that describe network communication.

## Layers
1. **Physical** – Cables, switches, signals  
2. **Data Link** – MAC addresses, switches  
3. **Network** – IP addresses, routing  
4. **Transport** – TCP/UDP  
5. **Session** – Managing sessions  
6. **Presentation** – Data format, encryption  
7. **Application** – End-user applications

## Key Notes
- Remember: "Please Do Not Throw Sausage Pizza Away" for the layer order.
- TCP is connection-oriented; UDP is connectionless.
